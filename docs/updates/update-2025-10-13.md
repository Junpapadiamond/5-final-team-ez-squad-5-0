# Update — 2025-10-13

## Current Platform Snapshot
- Couples flow spans Auth, Daily Question, Quiz, Messages, and Calendar sharing Mongo collections (`docs/overview/README.md:3`).
- Auth issues JWTs, manages partner invitations, and notification preferences (`docs/auth/README.md:3`).
- Messages handles real-time and scheduled partner notes with UTC normalization and email alerts (`docs/messages/README.md:3`).
- Daily Question provides deterministic prompts and answer storage for both partners (`docs/daily-question/README.md:3`).
- Quiz runs synchronized compatibility sessions with scoring history in `quiz_sessions` (`docs/quiz/README.md:3`).
- Calendar keeps shared plans aligned with partner-aware queries and formatting (`docs/calendar/README.md:3`).

## Agent Architecture Today
- `AgentLLMClient` wraps OpenAI Responses/Chat APIs with JSON schemas and payload normalizers (`api-container/app/services/agent_llm_client.py:18`).
- `AgentOrchestrator` assembles partner, daily-question, message, event, and style data for each LLM call (`api-container/app/services/agent_orchestrator.py:18`).
- `AgentAnalysisService` hashes drafts, reuses cached tone results, and falls back to heuristics (`api-container/app/services/agent_analysis_service.py:35`).
- `AgentSuggestionService` merges OpenAI coaching cards with deterministic reminders and caches merged bundles (`api-container/app/services/agent_suggestion_service.py:17`).
- `StyleProfileService` builds linguistic fingerprints and optionally enriches them with LLM summaries (`api-container/app/services/style_profile_service.py:49`).
- Frontend agent page surfaces AI provenance, cache status, and sentiment badges (`frontend/src/app/agent/page.tsx:1`).

## Response-Speed Optimizations
- Limit Mongo lookups to the three most recent messages/events and project only needed fields before prompting (`api-container/app/services/agent_orchestrator.py:85`).
- Cache the assembled context per request so tone analysis and suggestion generation reuse the same data (`api-container/app/services/agent_suggestion_service.py:17`).
- Reduce style-profile sampling (e.g., ≤75 messages) to avoid scanning 200 documents every refresh cycle (`api-container/app/services/style_profile_service.py:53`).
- Lower default `AGENT_*_MAX_TOKENS` and trim prompt sections aggressively; env toggles already exist (`api-container/app/services/agent_llm_client.py:119`).
- Instrument token/latency logging and defer suggestion refreshes asynchronously so cached responses return instantly (`docs/agent/api-integration-v1.md:42`).

## Intelligence Enhancements
- Ship the RAG ingest pipeline plus `/api/insights/query` to ground coaching in historical answers and curated tips (`docs/agent/Agent_RAG_Implementation.md:50`).
- Implement workflow state machines for onboarding, daily nudges, quiz follow-ups, and anniversaries (`docs/agent/Agent_RAG_Implementation.md:75`).
- Collect user feedback on each suggestion to tune prompt weighting and acceptance scoring (`docs/agent/Agent_RAG_Implementation.md:102`).
- Feed style-profile traits directly into prompts for consistent voice mirroring (`docs/agent/Agent_RAG_Implementation.md:69`).
- Combine deterministic business checks with retrieved knowledge to boost action confidence (`api-container/app/services/agent_suggestion_service.py:52`).

## Voice Integration Outline
- Design opt-in, consent, and storage flows for voice capture before cloning (`docs/ideas.md:3`).
- Capture 30-second voice samples securely alongside existing messaging data (`docs/ideas.md:9`).
- Integrate compliant TTS (OpenAI Voice, ElevenLabs) guarded by feature flags and conditioned on style traits (`docs/ideas.md:10`).
- Reuse messaging/scheduling to draft, review, and queue voice notes just like text cards (`docs/ideas.md:30`).
- Add ASR (Whisper, Deepgram) for two-way voice loops feeding back into tone analysis (`docs/ideas.md:10`).

## Future Roadmap
- Deliver the Daily Engagement Copilot as the next agent milestone (`docs/ideas.md:15`).
- Explore timed creative messages and handwritten cards for differentiated touchpoints (`docs/ideas.md:30`).
- Investigate wellness logging with strict consent to expand empathetic context (`docs/ideas.md:21`).
- Plan partner-facing weekly summaries after RAG consent plumbing lands (`docs/agent/Agent_RAG_Implementation.md:97`).

## AI PM Positioning Highlights
- Storyline: heuristics → structured OpenAI outputs → RAG/voice roadmap with measurable responsiveness gains.
- Cross-functional ownership: backend services, Mongo schemas, React UI, deployment toggles under one initiative.
- Metrics-first narrative: cached analyses, latency wins, and explicit safeguards (fallbacks, consent flags).
- Rollout strategy: feature flags, cache-first UX, and async refresh to balance latency, cost, and reliability.
