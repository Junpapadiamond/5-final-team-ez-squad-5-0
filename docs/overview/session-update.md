# Session Fixes & Findings

## Changes Implemented
- **Readable inputs everywhere** — enforced dark text and white backgrounds for form controls via `globals.css`, and applied explicit typography classes on message inputs so entries are visible against light themes.
- **Message scheduling polish** — normalised submitted timestamps with `Date.toISOString()`, added descriptive error bubbling, exposed `PUT /api/messages/scheduled/<id>` for in-place edits, and refreshed the UI with edit/cancel controls plus local-time formatting.
- **Timezone correctness** — ensured scheduled deliveries persist as UTC while respecting the caller’s local offset, preventing the four-hour drift that triggered premature sends.
- **Dynamic compatibility sessions** — replaced the one-off quiz submission flow with partner-synchronised sessions, including configurable question counts, per-question match tracking, live progress, and aggregated status metrics.

## Bugs & Root Causes Uncovered
- **Invisible input text** — default form styles inherited a near-white font colour, making entries unreadable on white backgrounds; global and component-level overrides resolve it.
- **Scheduled messages firing hours early** — the frontend appended `Z` to local times, mislabelling them as UTC and causing a 4-hour shift. Converting via `toISOString()` now preserves intent.
- **Cancellations failing silently** — attempts to cancel pending messages returned a generic 400 because the status had already flipped when the time drifted; error propagation now clarifies whether a message is already sent/cancelled or owned by someone else.
- **Quiz mismatch with product vision** — legacy endpoints only stored solo submissions; new requirements for “wait for partner then score” prompted the session-based redesign and new `quiz_sessions` collection.
